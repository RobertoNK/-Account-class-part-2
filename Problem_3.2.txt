Modify the Account class (section 3.3) by adding two instance
variables containing the customer's name and the account 
number (both will be string objects). Modify the primary
constructor for the Account class so that it takes three
parameters: the balance, the customer's name, and the 
account number. Add the instance mehtos named getCustomerName
and getAccountNumber that return the customer's name and the
account number. Modify the TestAccount (sesction 3.6) so
it tests the new constructor and the new methods.
